            Please remember that we use [**fast-forward merge**](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#Documentation/git-merge.txt---ff-only) instead of using the usual *"Create a merge commit"*, *"Squash and merge"* or *"Rebase and merge"* for merging `develop` into `main` or vice versa.

            You can execute it by creating a new comment in this PR with the following content:
            ```
            fast-forward
            ```
            ***With an additional slash (`/`) before the command (`fast-forward`).***
            **Please create this comment only after all tests have been completed positively!**

            For merging your feature branch to `develop` please use [*squash and merge*](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits).

            Thanks! üôè
