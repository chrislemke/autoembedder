# How to contribute

## Poetry
We are using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the dependencies, for deployment, and the virtual environment. If you have not used it before please check out the [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to get started.

If you want to start working on the project. The first thing you have to do is:
```bash
poetry install
```
This installs all needed dependencies for development.

## Pre-commit hooks
We are using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure a consistent code style and to avoid common mistakes. Please install the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) and install the hook with:
```bash
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

## Homebrew
We are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage the dependencies for the development environment. Please install Homebrew and run
```bash
 brew bundle
```
to install the dependencies. If you don't want/can't use Homebrew, you can also install the dependencies manually.

## Conventional Commits
We are using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) to ensure a consistent commit message style. Please use the following commit message format:
```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

E.g.:
```bash
feat: add a new fantastic feature ðŸš€
```

## How to contribute
The following steps will give a short guide on how to contribute to this project:

- Create a personal [fork](https://github.com/chrislemke/autoembedder/fork) of the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/) is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Start from `develop` if it exists, else from `main`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code, and add some examples.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation. [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), [Pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint), and [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) can help you with it.
- Run all tests.
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed. Please follow the "[Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)".
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on [GitHub](https://github.com/), the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch!
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).
